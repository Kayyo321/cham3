# Development Status

**Evidence snapshot:** 2026-10-11. Current task M0-001 evidence: `docs/handoffs/M0-repository-build-baseline-rework.md` and independent Codex rereview `docs/reviews/M0-repository-build-baseline-codex-rereview.md` (commit `59b361651a6d5cbc0ecb91c5fc5e184ebee2eb3d`). The original handoff/review are preserved as historical evidence.

## Repository

- **Project specification:** `PROJECT.md` exists and is the canonical product specification.
- **Branch:** the default branch `origin` (tracking `origin/origin`) does not yet contain M0-001. M0-001 work is on the unmerged branch `task/M0-repository-build-baseline`.
- **Inspected base commit:** `26eada8258eca60935319520c05917a8a547cdbf`.
- **Task preparation commit:** `d988253caf8e1ba55b4dc45764f6ec3e51fd2803` (parent `26eada8`). It adds the M0-001 task record and this status update. The working tree was clean when implementation started.
- **Implementation evidence (branch `task/M0-repository-build-baseline`, implementation commit `5ae0dc5`):** a Debian live-build configuration for a minimal Debian 13 amd64 live development image; build, static-check and secret-scan scripts; a documentation-only `cham3-base` M0 skeleton package; a QEMU boot-test harness; `unittest` suites; a GitHub Actions workflow; and `docs/engineering/developer_setup.md`. There is no cham3 product functionality: no services, enforcement, contracts, sandboxing, networking modes, desktop or installer.
- **Current milestone/task:** M0-001 is READY_TO_MERGE. Codex APPROVE and GitHub Actions PASS at exact target `8029ccdde09b205c9a477d5e6745716b9242cdfb`, implementation `526bacccdc3c38e8d61a15cb8e50af85d4cc7557`. R1/R2 are resolved and all acceptance criteria have evidence. Owner authorized merge into `origin` and remote push on 2026-10-11. Codex is the current INTEGRATOR; post-merge checks remain required before M0 completion.

## Verified state

- Product requirements are documented in `PROJECT.md`.
- Agent/workflow documentation is present in the repository.
- **Build status (M0-001, `5ae0dc5`):**
  - PASS for the package build and the live image build, from a clean checkout in a disposable Debian 13.7 amd64 VM under QEMU TCG emulation, following `docs/engineering/developer_setup.md`.
  - ISO sha256 `060382a0daba662d6f2354ce9abcbdde77c9337743f699ffeef2dea0e0bf1478`.
  - Native-hardware build: NOT_RUN.
  - Bit-for-bit reproducibility is not claimed.
- **Test status (M0-001, `5ae0dc5`):**
  - PASS for static checks; the static (70), packaging (8) and image (17) suites in the VM; and the boot (18) suite on the host.
  - GitHub Actions: NOT_RUN, because the branch has not been pushed.
  - Independent Codex checks at `82b0cfc`: PASS for static checks, 70 static tests with zero skips, package build/lintian and 8 package tests as non-root in an unprivileged disposable Debian trixie linux/amd64 container under emulation; 14 boot-classifier unit tests PASS on the host.
  - Independent failure-path probes: FAIL for R1 (scanner reports PASS with grep missing) and R2 (build wrapper continues after configuration failure and reports PASS). Probes used only synthetic fixtures/fault injection; they are not real image or enforcement tests.
  - Independent GitHub query: workflow-specific query BLOCKED by HTTP 404; branch-wide query PASS with no runs (`[]`). No exact-target passing GitHub Actions evidence is available.
- **Author-recorded rework status (M0-001, `526bacc`):**
  - PASS, as non-root in a disposable Debian 13.3 amd64 container and in a clean Debian 13.7 amd64 VM (TCG): static checks, 82 static tests (0 skipped), package build (lintian exit 0) and 8 package tests.
  - PASS in the VM: real image build (ISO sha256 `ed1165d57926f2521d629d0b10430f4bf4e2938410ea2bdfb433849c9e3da71d`) and 17 image tests.
  - PASS: host-QEMU BIOS boot to a login prompt, and 18 boot tests.
  - R1/R2 regression controls: 8 failures before the fix (`ac36295`), all pass after it. They are synthetic fault injection, not image or enforcement tests.
  - GitHub Actions, UEFI and native hardware: NOT_RUN.
- **Independent rereview (`8029ccdde09b205c9a477d5e6745716b9242cdfb`):**
  - PASS: static checks, 82 static tests (zero skips), real unsigned package build/lintian and 8 package tests as non-root in an unprivileged disposable Debian 13.3 `debian:trixie` linux/amd64 container under emulation.
  - PASS: original missing-grep probe returns 2; original configuration-failure probe returns 1 and calls only `config`; no ISO published. Additional non-root config/entry-failure assertions leave exactly `build.log`.
  - Sensitivity PASS: 30 scanner/wrapper tests reproduce 8 failures at tests-only `ac36295`, with positive controls passing; all 30 pass at `526bacc`. Synthetic control-flow coverage only.
  - PASS: provenance source, ISO digest binding, committed provenance/manifest checksums, config hashes, epoch and manifest consistency; committed serial-log classification; 14 synthetic boot-classifier unit tests.
  - Independent full image build/real boot rerun: NOT_RUN. Author VM records were inspected; absent raw ISO/build-log bytes were not independently hashed.
  - GitHub query PASS: `gh run list --branch task/M0-repository-build-baseline-rework --json databaseId,headSha,conclusion,status,url,workflowName` returned `[]`; GitHub Actions execution remains NOT_RUN. No exact-target passing run is evidenced.
- **Boot/image status (M0-001):**
  - PASS: the image booted to a serial login prompt in a disposable QEMU TCG VM (SeaBIOS, no disk, no network) on the macOS arm64 host.
  - UEFI and hardware boot: NOT_RUN.
  - A boot result demonstrates no security property.

## Implementation, defects, reviews

- **Exact-target GitHub Actions gate:** PASS, [run 38173172929](https://github.com/Kayyo321/cham3/actions/runs/38173172929) at `8029ccdde09b205c9a477d5e6745716b9242cdfb`. All three jobs succeeded: static checks/82 tests, unsigned package build/lintian/8 tests, real image build/17 image tests/QEMU boot/18 boot tests. Evidence: `docs/evidence/M0-repository-build-baseline/ci_8029ccd.json`. Earlier NOT_RUN observations above are historical. Privileged image work ran only on a disposable GitHub-hosted runner. No runtime enforcement or bit-for-bit reproducibility claim.

- **Implemented functionality:** M0 build and repository foundations only, on an unmerged branch under review. No cham3 product functionality from `PROJECT.md` is implemented.
- **Partial functionality:** Unknown.
- **Known defects:** R1/R2 from `82b0cfc` are closed by independent rereview at `8029ccd`; no new confirmed scoped defects. Existing concerns and verification limits remain in `docs/reviews/M0-repository-build-baseline-codex-rereview.md`.
- **Active tasks / pending gates:** M0-001 (`docs/tasks/M0-repository-build-baseline.md`) is READY_TO_MERGE with Codex approval and exact-target CI recorded. Next owner: Codex INTEGRATOR for the owner-authorized merge, push and post-merge checks. DONE has not been set.
- **Architectural blockers:** Details left open by `PROJECT.md` require ADRs before dependent implementation, including concrete app identity/attribution mechanism, resource-specific mediation boundaries, network backend interfaces, and operational key recovery details.

## Recommended next work

1. Complete the owner-authorized merge/push and record post-merge checks. Material implementation changes require renewed review. Resolve package metadata and license placeholders before publication. M0 remains incomplete until post-merge verification succeeds. Historical reviews remain unchanged.
2. Before cryptographic or privileged implementation, split specification details into owner-approved ADRs and define testable interfaces.

Do not update this status based on plans, generated code claims, or chat summaries alone. Link commits, files, and test artifacts for any new implementation claim.
